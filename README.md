# Apollo Foundation Edu Solve Hackathon
Team Name: TECHNO DEMONS
Participants: S.Josteve, Harshith Ashok, R.Yuvaraj, M.Sriraman Introduction
Economy is the root of a nation; development is its fruit. Production is the backbone of a country; wealth is its produce. Entrepreneurship is an art; people are its colours!
Such an economy’s plummet translates to a country’s pitfall. The current COVID-19 Pandemic has hindered India’s growth and thwarted its development.
One of its reverberation is unemployment- the fiend that falters the economy. A slew of people has lost their jobs and are rendered homeless without a way to earn money. COVID-19 has flayed the local businesses and has impeded them from progress.
Keeping this in mind, our team Techno-demons have designed a viable solution to overcome unemployment and to find jobs and employees effectively.
   
Profit Plot -Money made easy
Our business model and app prototype ‘Profit Plot’ not only has application to the unemployed but also to employers to select a suitable employee for the job.
The people who need a job can input their credentials or skills by clicking the ‘Share your skills’ button.
It not only renders monetary support to local businesses but also provides a way for employers to choose the best employee.
Users of this app can donate money to those who are in need of start-up money or capital. This can be done by clicking the ‘Donate’ option in the menu.
   
The unemployed workers can use this fund to begin their business or get a job using the services provided. They can repay it if required.
Profit Plot can also be used to share your skills and knowledge through a video for others’ benefit. It can be easily done by choosing the ‘Share your skills’ button.
These tutorials can be viewed by other users who want to master a specific field or learn new abilities.
One of its other application is to make products of local businesses and cottage industries available online. These products are made available directly to the customers who wish to buy these. The ‘Sales’ button should be clicked to browse through these products.
Navigation through the app is made easy via a sidebar menu which consists of the following options: Job, Skill, Sales, Donate, About.

Day-2
  The need of today’s society in the COVID crisis is to create job opportunities for those who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.

Our app prototype provides a feasible way to deal with the unemployment, employee recruitment and sales opportunities that our society needs currently.
The ‘Donations’ option enables the user to donate money to those in need. Through this way, monetary support and funding is provided to those unemployed due to the pandemic.
Our app is also a platform to sell hand-made products and to buy products of small scale industries and individual enterprises.
Job recruitment is made efficient by using the ‘referring’ feature which enables users to rate and recommend employees to employers.
In this way, the society is benefitted by our project. Thank you!
